  <p>The specific components in this architecture are the following:</p>
   		<div style="padding-left: 30px" >
  		<u1>
  			<li><b>Minifi - </b> Collect Events from the Edge. The edge here represents collecting events from the different sensors on the truck</li>
  			<li><b>Nifi - </b> Performs site to site data movement,  intelligent data routing, transformations, enrichment, and delivers the streams to the stream processing engine. 
  			<li><b>Kafka - </b> Scalable Event Broker that acts as the distributed storage Substrate for the Stream Processing engine </li>
  			<li> <b>Storm - </b>Streaming analytics engine used to build a stream application demonstrating joining streams, windoweed aggreation, fast real-tile model scoring, serving requests to Dashboard  </li>
  			<li> <b>HBase - </b> Store the Time-Series Trucking Events for Fast Access</li>
